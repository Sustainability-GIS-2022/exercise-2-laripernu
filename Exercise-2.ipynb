    "In this exercise, we will practice network analysis and spatial accessibility modelling. Our overall goal is to analyze healthcare accessibility by conducting a two-step floating catchment area analysis in Helsinki Region. We will calculate travel time-based catchment areas by driving (10 minutes threshold) from selected hospitals and postal code areas in the Helsinki Region. Based on the population information and the number of physicians at given hospital (simulated --> not real), we can calculate an accessibility index based on 2SFCA method. The end result should look something like following:\n",
