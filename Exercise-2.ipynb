For each problem you need to modify the notebook by adding your own programming solutions or written text. Remember to save and commit your changes locally, and push your changes to GitHub after each major change! Regular commits will help you to keep track of your changes (and revert them if needed).

Hence, it is recommended that you start immediately working on them."

    "In this exercise, we will practice network analysis and spatial accessibility modelling. Our overall goal is to analyze healthcare accessibility by conducting a two-step floating catchment area analysis in Helsinki Region. We will calculate travel time-based catchment areas by driving (10 minutes threshold) from selected hospitals and postal code areas in the Helsinki Region. Based on the population information and the number of physicians at given hospital (simulated --> not real), we can calculate an accessibility index based on 2SFCA method. The end result should look something like following:\n",

These steps have been taken to make the data a bit more realistic, but they cannot be considered to reflect reality.

    "\n",
    " 1. calculate a catchment area for each hospital (n=27) based on the routable graph (by driving) that was created in Problem 1 (you need to loop over hospitals). You should use Networkx to do the calculations. See the Tutorial materials to understand what are the required steps. **You should calculate the travel times only up to 10 minutes** (i.e. 600 seconds). Note: It will take awhile to calculate these.\n",
    "   - **Hint: Before looping over all hospitals it is MUCH RECOMMENDED to first iterate over e.g. a couple of hospitals to see that things are working as should.** This is one of the good coding practices: test with a small sample before running a longer calculation (it saves times and nerves). \n",
    " 2. Make a spatial join between the **population grid** (i.e. the HSY population distribution data) and the network **nodes** that come as a result with the given 10 minute catchment area, and store it into a variable. As a result you should have something like following, in which specific population grid cells are selected if they intersect with the network nodes (10 minute catchment area): \n",

    " 4. From the row of the given hospital (which you are iterating) get the number of physicians and store it into a variable (convert it into an integer)\n",
    " 5. Calculate the prover-to-population ratio by dividing the number of physicians by the population sum within given catchment, and store it into a variable. \n",
    " 6. Convert the selected the grid cells fell within the catchment area into a MultiPolygon by making an unary union the Polygon geometries (check geopandas *unary_union*). After this step, you should get a single shapely geometry instead of multiple rows of data in GeoDataFrame.\n",
